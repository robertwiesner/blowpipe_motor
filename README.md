# Glassblowing adapter

This project is to build a blow pipe adapter to help with solo blowing. In contras to the external compressor to the blowpie using a hose. 
The goals include
* Identic PCB for blowpipe and wireless controller
* Easy configurable
* Using Wifi or Bluetooth as communication between the remote control and blow piep adapter
* Measuing the set and create air pressure
* Worktime at last 4 hours on one charge
* Reasonable cost effective

I'm using a Rasperry Pi Pico W running Micropython.

The repository contains
* Schematics for the PCB
* FreeCAD 0.21 models with easy adjustments for the adapter and remote control
